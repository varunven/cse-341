(* The main assignment used pre-parsed JSON data, but now we will
   implement a parser for JSON. The course staff's solution to this
   section was used to create the pre-parsed data used earlier. With
   your own parser, you can go off and explore other datasets in OCaml.

   This parser is difficult but rewarding. Getting comfortable with
   parsing and with the functional programming ideas used to implement
   it will serve you well in the long run. Even if you don't finish
   the whole parser, you will learn from trying at least a few of the
   tokenization problems. *)

(* Parsing is the problem of converting a textual representation into
   a structured representation. For example, turning
       { "foo" : 3.14, "bar" : [true, false] }
   into the corresponding json value. Parsers are also used in compilers
   to convert source code into a suitable internal representation.

   Parsing a very well-studied problem in computer science. If you
   take a compilers class, you will probably spend at least two weeks
   on different parsing algorithms. This can give the impression that
   parsing is so hard that only experts should attempt it.  But
   certain parsing techniques are actually very straightforward to
   implement, especially in a functional language such as OCaml. *)

(* Our goal is to turn a string into a json value. We will divide the
   problem into two steps, called tokenization and parsing.

   The purpose of tokenization is to make the parsing problem easier
   by grouping related characters of the input together.

   Tokenization will turn the string into a list of "tokens", which
   are pieces of the input that "go together". It may help to think of
   tokens as the "words" or "indivisible atoms" of the input.

   For example, tokenizing the string
       { "foo" : 3.14, "bar" : [true, false] }
   will result in something like the list
       [LBrace, StrLit "foo", Colon, NumLit "3.14", Comma,
        StringLit "bar", Colon, LBracket, TrueTok, Comma,
        FalseTok, RBracket, RBrace]
   Notice how the characters representing field names have been grouped
   together, as have those representing the number 3.14. True and False
   have been represented specially, as has all punctuation. Also, all
   whitespace has been removed.

   We will generally work with lists of characters (char lists)
   instead of strings, so that we can use our favorite tools of
   recursion and pattern matching to write the tokenizer. The 
   provided helper functions string_of_char_list and char_list_of_string
   convert between the two representations.

   Character literals in OCaml are written just as in Java, between single quotes. 

   Our tokens will be represented by the following datatype:
*)
type token =
  NumLit of string (* eg, number 3.14 represented as "3.14" *)
| StringLit of string (* eg, "foo" *)
| FalseTok (* false *)
| TrueTok  (* true *)
| NullTok  (* null *)
| LBrace   (* { *)
| RBrace   (* } *)
| LBracket (* [ *)
| RBracket (* ] *)
| Comma    (* , *)
| Colon    (* : *)

(* For debugging purposes, it will be convenient to be able to print
   tokens. Here is a provided function to convert tokens to strings. *)
let string_of_token t = 
match t with
  NumLit    s ->  s
| StringLit s -> quote_string s
| FalseTok    -> "false"
| TrueTok     -> "true"
| NullTok     -> "null"
| LBrace      -> "{"
| RBrace      -> "}"
| LBracket    -> "["
| RBracket    -> "]"
| Comma       -> ","
| Colon       -> ":"

exception LexicalError of string
(* Helper function to report lexical errors conveniently.
   ("Lexical analysis" is another name for "tokenization".) *)
let lexical_error msg = raise (LexicalError ("Lexical error: " ^ msg))


(* The general idea of the tokenizer will be to examine the beginning
   of the character list to find the next token, "consume" it, and
   then continue to process the rest of the list. Here, "consuming"
   just means to process the first few characters of the list, and
   return the rest of them for later processing.

   In other words, a function to consume a foo will have type
       char list -> foo * char list
   that is, it takes the char list, and converts the first bit of it
   into a foo, and returns the remainder of the list.

   We will write three consumers, one for string literals, one for
   keywords (false, true, and null), and one for numeric literals.
 *)

(* Challenge Problem C1: Write a consumer for string literals. String literals
   are required to be quoted in JSON, so your consumer should look for
   a double quote, and then keep consuming characters until it sees
   the closing double quote.

   Call `lexical_error` with an appropriate message if there is
   no string literal at the beginning of the given character list.

   Also call `lexical_error` if the string literal at the beginning of
   the list has no closing double quote.

   Hint: After accepting the opening double quote, use a helper
         function to recursively look for the closing double quote,
         returning the string of characters in between, and the remainder.
*)
let consume_string_literal cs = 
  (* TODO: add about 10 lines of code to this function, and edit the "failwith" line below. *)
  match cs with
    '\"' :: cs -> failwith "consume_string_literal should now call a helper function to consume rest of string"
  | _ -> lexical_error "Expecting string literal."


(* Challenge Problem C2: Write a consumer for the keywords true, false, and null.

   Call `lexical_error` with an appropriate message if the given
   character list does not start with a keyword.

   Hint: One way to do this is to use pattern matching to look for
         the sequence of characters for each keyword.

   Hint: Another (in our opinion, cleaner) way is to write a helper
         consumer that looks for an *arbitrary* sequence of alphabetic
         characters, and then to use `assoc` from the homework assignment
         to convert the string to a token using a lookup table such as
             [("true", TrueTok), ("false", FalseTok), ("null", NullTok)].

         (This takes advantage of the fact that assoc has a relatively
         general type, allowing the second components of the pairs to have
         *any* type whatsoever.)

         Remember that assoc returns an option -- report a lexical error as 
         appropriate.

         You can check whether a character `c` is alphabetic using the
         provided helper function is_alpha.

   Either of the above strategies will receive full credit.

let consume_keyword cs = 
  (* TODO, about 15 lines *) failwith "consume_keyword unimplemented"

(* Here's a provided consumer for numbers, since it's a bit complex.
   You shouldn't need to understand this code unless you want to.

   JSON uses a fairly common textual format for floating point numbers.
   The format described in Section 6 of RFC 7159, which we summarize here.

   A number consists of an optional minus sign, followed by an integer
   part, followed by an optional fractional part, followed by an
   optional exponent part.

       number = [ '-' ] int [ frac ] [ exp ]

   where single quotes enclose literal characters and square brackets
   denote optional components.

   The integer part is a nonempty sequence of digits, which may only
   start with a 0 if the entire integer part is 0.

       int = '0'
           | nonzero-digit digit*

       nonzero-digit = '1' | '2' | ... | '9'

       digit = '0' | nonzero-digit

   where vertical bars (|) denote alternatives and stars ( * ) denote
   0-or-more repetitions.

   The fractional part is a period followed by one or more digits.

       frac = '.' digit+

   where plus (+) denotes 1-or-more repetitions.

   The exponent part is a letter E (lowercase or uppercase), followed
   by an optional sign (minus or plus), followed by one or more
   digits.

       exp = e [ sign ] digit+

       e = 'e' | 'E'

       sign = '-' | '+'

   We structure consume_num in terms of several "helper consumers"
   that consume the various parts described above, such as the
   optional leading minus sign, or the fractional part, and so on.
*)
let consume_num cs = 
  let consume_minus xs = 
      match xs with
        ('-' :: cs) -> (['-'], cs)
      | cs -> ([], cs)
  in
  let consume_exp_sign xs = 
      match xs with
        ('-' :: cs) -> (['-'], cs)
      | ('+' :: cs) -> (['+'], cs)
      | cs -> ([], cs)
  in
  let consume_digit_list cs =
    let rec loop pr = 
      match pr with
        (acc, []) -> (List.rev acc, [])
      | (acc, (c :: cs)) ->
        if is_digit c then 
          loop ((c :: acc), cs)
        else 
          (List.rev acc, c :: cs)
    in
    loop ([], cs)
  in
  let consume_frac xs = 
    match xs with

      let (l, cs) = consume_digit_list cs in
      ('.' :: l, cs)
    | cs -> ([], cs)
  in
  let consume_exp xs = 
    match xs with
    (c :: cs) ->
    if c = 'e' || c = 'E' then
      let (sign, cs) = consume_exp_sign cs in
      let (l, cs) = consume_digit_list cs  in
      (c :: sign @ l, cs)
    else

  let (exp,   cs) = consume_exp        cs in
  (string_of_char_list (minus @ int @ frac @ exp), cs)


(* We now have all the consumers we need to write the main tokenizer loop. *)

(* Challenge Problem C3: Complete the following definition of `tokenize_char_list`
   that implements the tokenizer.

   Call `lexical_error` with an appropriate message if you encounter an
   unexpected character. (Use char_to_string to get a printable
   representation of a character.)

   Hint: You'll need to have one branch per kind of token, plus a few
         more to skip whitespace.

   Hint: Use the consumers from above.

   Hint: Remember to look for whitespace so that you can correctly ignore it.

(* Challenge Problem C4: Write the top level tokenizer that takes a string,
   converts it to a char list, and passes it to `tokenize_char_list`.

   Hint: use char_list_of_string and tokenize_char_list *)
let tokenize (s : string) : token list =
  (* TODO, 1 line *) failwith "tokenize unimplemented"


(* The tokenizer produces a list of tokens, which we now need to
   actually parse into a json value. We will structure our parser in a
   very similar way to the "consumers" used above in the tokenizer,
   except that parsers will work on token lists instead of char lists.

   For example, to parse a foo, we will write a function
       parse_foo : token list -> foo * token list
   which examines the beginning of the token list and converts it to a foo,
   returning the remainder of the list.

   *)

(* First, here's a provided function to report a syntax error. It takes
   the current token list and a message, and raises an exception. It
   uses the token list to print out the current token (or "EOF"
   standing for "end of file" if there are no tokens left), which
   helps when debugging to know where in the token list the error
   occurred. *)

    match ts with
      [] -> "EOF"
    | t :: _ -> string_of_token t
  in
  raise (SyntaxError ("Syntax error at " ^ tokenName ^ ": " ^ msg))

(* As a very simple (but still useful below) example, we can write a
   parser that consumes a string literal at the beginning of the token
   list. *)

(* Challenge Problem C5: write a `parse_string` function that consumes a string
   literal at the beginning of the token list and returns it.

   If there is no string literal at the beginning of the token list,
   call `syntax_error` with the token list and an appropriate message.
*)
let parse_string (ts : token list) : string * token list =
  (* TODO, about 3 lines *) failwith "parse_string unimplemented"

(* It is often useful to consume a single token from the token list
   and throw it away, returning the rest of the tokens and throwing an
   error if the token was not there. *)

(* Challenge Problem C6: write a function `expect` which consumes a single,
   specific token from the token list.

   If the token is not there as expected, call syntax_error with an
   appropriate message. *)
let expect (t, ts) = 
  (* TODO, about 6 lines *) failwith "expect unimplemented"


(* We're now ready to start writing a `parse_json` function, which
   will contain several local helper functions. In this case, it is
   important that these helper functions be local and not at the top
   level, because they need to recursively call `parse_json`.

   This also makes these functions much more difficult to test, since
   they are not available at the top level scope. (There are ways
   around this, eg, using mutual recursion instead of nested
   functions.) So you'll just need to test `parse_json` extra
   thoroughly to ensure each local helper function is working properly.

   You may want to skip the helper function problems at first and
   work on the main body of parse_json (after the let...in), where
   you can parse everything except objects and arrays, and then come
   back to the helper functions later to complete the function.
*)
let rec parse_json (ts : token list) : json * token list =
    (* Challenge Problem C7: write a `parse_field_value` function that parses one
       field-value pair in an object.

       The syntax for a field-value pair is a string literal,
       representing the field name, followed by a colon, followed by
       an arbitrary json value.

       Hint: use `parse_string` for the field name, `expect` for the
             colon, and a recursive call to `parse_json` for the value. *)

       to parse strings representing objects, which are always
       surrounded in braces.)

       Hint: use parse_field_value to parse each field-value pair.

       Hint: First check to see if the first token is a closing
             brace. If so, immediately return the empty list.
             Otherwise, parse a field-value pair and then check
             whether the next token is a comma. If so, consume it an
             recursively parse a list of field-value pairs, and then
             cons the new field-value pair on the front. If it is not a comma,

             that it calls `parse_json` instead of

(* Open-ended challenge problem C11: use your parser to explore some other
   data than the ones we have provided. If you find something
   interesting, briefly write it up.

   One thing you may run into is that your parser does not handle all
   of JSON, so it may fail to parse some files. For example, we have
   not implemented support for escape sequences inside of string
   literals, which are fairly frequently used.

   If you run into any other incompatabilities, please mention them
   here, and for extra special bonus points, fix them. *)

(* Challenge Problem C12: implement parser support for escape sequences
   such as \\ and \n inside of string literals. This should
   require only changing consume_string_literal. The full list of
   string escapes in JSON can be found in Section 7 of RFC 7159 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-7).

   Also implement support for *printing* strings with escape
   sequences. This should require changing only quote_string. *)
