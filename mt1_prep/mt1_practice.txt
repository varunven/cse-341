1) yep

2a) let example_no_breakouts = 
	let dan = ("Dan" * false * false) in 
	let ken = ("Kenny" * true * true) in 
	let abdul = ("Abdul" * true * true) in
	Room [dan, ken, abdul]
2b) let example_full_breakouts = 
	let dan = ("Dan" * false * false) in 
	let ken = ("Kenny" * true * true) in 
	let abdul = ("Abdul" * true * true) in
	Breakouts[Room[dan]; Room[ken]; Room[abdul]]
	
3a) mystery1 computes the total number of people there are in all of the nested rooms in the breakout room passed in using tail recursion
3b) mystery2 returns a head-recursive list of every room in the nested breakouts
